# Reporting Issues

Well-formed issues save everyone time.

## Before Opening an Issue

- Confirm the issue is reproducible.
- Test on the latest commit.
- Search for duplicates.
- Ensure it is not a configuration or user-environment problem.

## Issue Requirements

Every issue must include:

- Clear, descriptive title
- Exact reproduction steps
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, version, hardware if relevant)
- Logs or error output (if applicable)

Incomplete issues may be closed.

# Feature Requests

Feature proposals must include:

- Clear use case
- Justification for inclusion
- Technical feasibility considerations
- Why it belongs in core rather than as a fork or extension

The project maintainers retain full discretion over roadmap direction.

---

# Pull Requests

Pull requests must be:

- Focused (one logical change per PR)
- Clean (no unrelated refactors)
- Tested
- Reproducible
- Free of unnecessary formatting noise

## Required Before Submission

- Rebase on latest default branch
- Ensure the project builds successfully
- Remove debug artifacts
- Avoid introducing warnings
- Confirm no regressions

If CI fails, the PR will not be merged.

# Code Standards

Contributors must:

- Follow the existing code style
- Preserve architectural integrity
- Avoid introducing hidden side effects
- Avoid speculative abstractions
- Prefer clarity over cleverness

If modifying core logic:

- Document why the change is necessary
- Explain potential side effects
- Identify affected subsystems

---

# Documentation Contributions

Documentation updates must:

- Be accurate
- Be concise
- Avoid redundancy
- Match repository terminology

Incorrect documentation is worse than missing documentation.

---

# Security Issues

Do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, contact:

contact@nathanneurotic.com

Security reports are handled privately.

---

# Decision Authority

Project maintainers have final authority over:

- Feature inclusion
- Architectural direction
- Merge decisions
- Enforcement of standards

Discussion is welcome. Entitlement is not.

---

# Behavioral Expectations

All contributors must adhere to the project's Code of Conduct.

Professionalism is mandatory.

---

# What Gets PRs Closed Quickly

- Drive-by refactors
- Style-only changes without discussion
- Unrequested dependency additions
- Breaking changes without prior agreement
- PRs that rewrite large sections without justification

---

# Contribution Philosophy
